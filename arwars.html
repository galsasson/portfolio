<h1>AR wars</h1>
<br />
<p>
A.R. Wars is a programming game. It was developed to help my class friends learn the 8086 assembly language. I found that many of my friends had difficulty learning the language and the main reason was the boring assignments that were given to us throughout the course.

<p>
This game is an online game, where each player creates his own robot by writing its program. Each robot has the same hardware and same peripherals, such as: a rocket launcher, a flame thrower, two wheels and a scanner. Every student can create his own robot, write its program, and save it in the online library. Later, matches between the robots can be held to see which robot has the best program.

This game, including the language parser and the virtual robots CPU, was written in flash to make it embeddable on an online website.
