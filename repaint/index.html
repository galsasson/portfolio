<h1>Re:Paint</h1>
<br />
<p>
<i>Re:Paint</i> is an experiment I made using <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/" target="_blank">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a> platform. In this experiment, I gave 84 mechanical turk workers a simple task - <i>"Copy the image on the right as precisely as possible"</i>. The workers were given a canvas and a simple pen tool for this task.</p>
<p>The first image to copy was of a plain square. After a worker has completed the task, a new task was automatically posted to mechanical turk with the task of copying the last image that was drawn by the last worker, creating a chain where each turker was promted to replicate the drawing of the previous one.

<p>
After 84 workers, this is what I got:<br />
<img src="img/paint-83.png" width="200px" />
</p>
<p>
This is the full chain of drawings:
<img src="img/all_small.png" width="600px" />
</p>
<p>
In this project I tried to use human error as a new form of randomness, using the imperfection of the tools we use, the computer mouse and the trackpad.
